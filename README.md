# The simex Package

This pakage for R implements the simex procedure developed by Cook & Stefanski for dealing with measurement error models, as well as the mcsimex for misclassified data developed by Küchenhoff, Mwalili and Lesaffre.

# Installation

It can be found on [CRAN] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simex/index.html) and installed with 

```R
install.packages("simex")
```

The most current version can be installed via 

```R
devtools::install_github("wolfganglederer/simex")
```

# simex NEWS:


## Version 1.8:

* `coxph` from survival is now supported (Rasmus Froberg Brøndum) & PR by Heidi
* website added (Wolfgang)
* smaller fixes (Wolfgang)

## Version 1.7:
(by Wolfgang Lederer)

- Option fitting.method in function simex() now really works properly for "linear" (Wolfgang)
- Smaller documentation fixes (Wolfgang)
- Uploaded to Github and moved documentation to roxygen2 (Wolfgang)
- Added support for proportional odds logistic regression (```polr``` from library MASS) (Chris Lawrence)

## Version 1.5:
(by Heidi Seibold & Wolfgang Lederer)

- Option fitting.method in function simex() now works properly for "linear" (Wolfgang)
- Measurement errors may now be heteroscedastic. Therefore the input-type had to be changed. The measurement error now has to be a  matrix. (Heidi)
- The functions simex and print.summary.simex were adjusted. (Heidi)

## Version 1.4:
(by Ph. Grosjean <phgrosjean@sciviews.org>)

- Object classes were renamed 'simex' and 'mcsimex' to match their constructor's names simex() and mcsimex().
- Interface of mcsimex() has been homogenized with the one of simex(), with fitting.method at the sixth place instead of last one.
- print() methods now return x invisibly, as they are supposed to do.
- predict() methods failed when newdata was not provided. Fixed.
- refit() is now a generic function with methods for objects 'simex' and 'mcsimex'. Its arguments have been reworked to match arguments of simex() and mcsimex() functions (jackknife becomes jackknife.estimation).
- A NAMESPACE is added and functions that are not supposed to be used by the end-user are now hidden in the namespace (construct.s(), fit.log() and fit.nls()).
- Documentation has been rewritten to match current R standards. Methods are now documented in the same page as the object creator. 'Overview' is rewritten and renamed 'simex-package'.
